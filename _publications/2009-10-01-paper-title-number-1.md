Highlights:

- An unsupervised sentence representation (embedding) method is proposed.

- Our method uses word embeddings and Information Theoretic principles behind TF–IDF.

- Word embeddings of a sentence contribute with their associated word information.

- The proposed method is modular and identifiable at sentence level.

- Results on well-known sentence similarity benchmarks are highly competitive.
